### Tech Stack Used:

#### Backend

- Express.js
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- JWT (for authentication)
- CryptoJS (for data encryption)
- Stripe API (for checkout 💳)

#### Frontend

- React
- Redux (to manage app state)
  - Redux Persist (for local storage)
- React-router-dom (to handle routing)

#### Future Plans 🚀

- [ ] To add an Admin Dashboard that would support CRUD operations for new products as well as create charts for user analytics, cost and total revenue.
- [ ] To make this application mobile responsive.
- [ ] And last but not the least is to use a hosting service like Heroku to deploy this application.
